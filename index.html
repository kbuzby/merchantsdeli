			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			<p>Merchant's Deli is a hometown delicatessen and caterer located in the center of Audubon's business district.</p>
            <p>We opened our doors in October of 2001. Over the years we have grown into a successful 'corner' deli supporting our residents, visitors, local and surrounding organizations.</p>
            <p>Our growth over the years has allowed us to introduce customers to our store roasted meats and our store made salads and dressings. We roast fresh turkey breast, beef, chicken breast and pork loins on the premises for you to take home deli cut, for catering, or in a sandwich. We make fresh gravy for all of our roasts for a quick hot meal. We offer a wonderful fresh salad bar and home made soups. <br> We carry Dietz and Watson, Belgiosi, Land or Lakes, New Yorker, Clearfield, Hatfield, Hormel & Lido meats and cheeses just to name a few. Each week we feature deli specials for meat and cheese, give us a call and we can let you know what they are!</p>
